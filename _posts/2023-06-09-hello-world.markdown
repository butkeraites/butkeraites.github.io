In the realm of science, tomorrow gleams,
A beacon of hope, defying the seams.
Curiosity stirs, a fire within,
Exploring the unknown, where wonders begin.

But skepticism looms, a shadow cast,
In the Brazilian market, a question asked.
The struggles faced, the system's strife,
Can it truly foster scientific life?

I pondered my path, with doubts profound,
Between academia and coding, I found.
A choice diverged, a different track,
To shape the future, with lines of code, I'd stack.

For in this realm, I see endless creation,
Building bridges, connecting every nation.
Technology's embrace, a world of its own,
Innovation unfurls, where dreams are sown.

Charles Bukowski's spirit, a rebel's soul,
Guides my steps, as I set my goal.
To challenge conventions, embrace the new,
And create a future, where dreams come true.

So, here I stand, with optimism in my stride,
The science of tomorrow, my passion's ride.
As a developer, I'll forge my way,
And shape a world where progress holds sway.

Hello, World! I declare with might,
A journey begins, in code's pure light.
Embracing the future, with eyes aglow,
Science and technology, a harmonious flow.

Through skepticism's haze, hope shall arise,
As I chart my course, with unwavering eyes.
The science of tomorrow, an ever-burning flame,
I'll contribute my part, in this exhilarating game.
